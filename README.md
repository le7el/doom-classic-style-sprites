# Classic DooM sprite renderer
2D sprite render component for Classic DooM style sprites for Unreal Engine 4 and 5.

[Example 1](https://github.com/le7el/doom-classic-style-sprites/blob/main/images/doom1.png?raw=true)

## Installation on Unreal Engine 5

Take the component `UE5.1/2DSpriteRender` and add it to the pawn that you'd like to make 2D. The component will do the rest, spawning the plane actor and setting the rendertargets. Also contains PP material for old 18-bit pixelated look. 

## Installation on Unreal Engine 4 (deprecated)

This is an outdated but usable version if you are still using Unreal Engine 4. Take the component `UE4.26/2DSpriteRender`, BP should be pretty much self explanatory.
